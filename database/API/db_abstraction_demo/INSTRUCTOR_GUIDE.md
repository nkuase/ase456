- **Real-world Application**: Spring Framework, Angular, enterprise applications
- **Assessment Opportunity**: Add configuration management and environment-specific implementations

### 4. **Database Technologies**
*Understanding Data Storage Options*

**Concepts Covered**:
- **SQLite**: Relational, local, ACID properties
