# Q3. Dart Lambda Expressions

---

## Question 3.1

What concept explains this idea:
**???** are anonymous functions defined inline without a name.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.2

Rewrite this regular function using a lambda expression.

```dart
// Regular function
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.3

(T/F) The Lambda expression can have multiple statements in it, but in this case, (1) the body should be in the block ({...}) and (2) we should use `return` to return any value.

```dart
// Lambda with multiple statements
var processData = (String data) {
  var processed = data.trim().toLowerCase();
  return processed.split(' ');
};
```

---

## Question 3.4

This is a list of why lambda expressions are powerful and useful. Which is wrong?

- **Concise code**: Less boilerplate
- **Inline logic**: Define the function where it's used
- **Functional programming**: Work with higher-order functions
- **Event handling**: Perfect for callbacks
- **Implements OOP features**: Objects & classes

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.5

What's the difference between arrow syntax (=>) and block syntax ({}) in lambda expressions?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.6

```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

Use lambda expressions with the List method map to get the list that is 2 times the numbers list.

(Hint: Don't forget to use toList() at the end of the code to make a list.)

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.7

```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

Use lambda expressions with the List method to get even numbers from the numbers list.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.8

```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

Use lambda expressions with the List method forEach to print each item.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.9

```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

Use lambda expressions with the List method any to find any value that is an even number.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.10

```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

Use lambda expressions with the List method every to find any value that is larger than 0.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.11

This is the reduce function. Explain how we get the sum of a list using this function.

```dart
// reduce: Combine all elements into a single value
int sum = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.12

In this code, we can give the function type value as an argument. What is the keyword in ???

```dart
int operatorSelector(??? func, int a, int b) {
  return func(a, b);
}
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.13

We want to use this operatorSelector to add two int values. Write code to do that.

```dart
int operatorSelector(Funciton func, int a, int b) {
  return func(a, b);
}
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3.14

This is the function that returns a function from the input string.

```dart
Function returnFunction(String func) {
  // Return a function based on the input string
  if (func == 'add') {
    return (a, b) => a + b;
  } else if (func == 'multiply') {
    return (a, b) => a * b;
  } else {
    throw Exception('Unknown function type');
  }
}
```

Write code that uses this function to add two values.
