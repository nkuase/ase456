# Q4. Dart Higher-Order Functions with Lambda

---

## Question 1

- **Take other functions as parameters**
- **Return functions as results**
- **Work with collections** (Lists, Sets, etc.)
- **Make code longer**

This is a list of higher-order function characteristics to define them, which is wrong?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 2

This is an example of using high-order functions (HOF). Explain what each HOF does.

```dart
// Example: map() takes a function as parameter
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.map((x) => x * 2); 
numbers.where((x) => x > 3);
numbers.fold(0, (sum, value) => sum + value); 
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 3

How does the map() function work and what is its primary purpose?

```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
List<int> doubled = numbers.map((x) => x * 2).toList();
print(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// Transform to different types
List<String> numberStrings = numbers.map((x) => 'Number: $x').toList();
print(numberStrings); // ['Number: 1', 'Number: 2', ...]

// Transform objects
List<Person> people = [Person('Alice', 25), Person('Bob', 30)];
List<String> names = people.map((person) => person.name).toList();
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 4

How does the where() function work for filtering data?

```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

// Filter even numbers
List<int> evens = numbers.where((x) => x % 2 == 0).toList();
print(evens); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// Filter numbers greater than 5
List<int> large = numbers.where((x) => x > 5).toList();
print(large); // [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

// Filter strings by length
List<String> words = ['cat', 'elephant', 'dog', 'butterfly'];
List<String> longWords = words.where((word) => word.length > 3).toList();
print(longWords); // ['elephant', 'butterfly']
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 6

What's the difference between fold() and reduce() functions? (Hint: focus on the initial value)

```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Sum with initial value 0
int sum = numbers.fold(0, (prev, curr) => prev + curr); print(sum); // 15

// Concatenate to string with initial value
String result = numbers.fold('Numbers: ', (prev, curr) => prev + '$curr '); 
print(result); // 'Numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 '
```

```dart
// Sum without initial value
int sum = numbers.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr); print(sum); // 15

// Find maximum
int max = numbers.reduce((prev, curr) => prev > curr ? prev : curr);
print(max); // 5
```

**Answer:**

---

## Question 7

(T/F) fold() is more flexible, reduce() is simpler for same-type operations.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 8

When should you use forEach() and how does it differ from map()?

```dart
List<String> students = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];

// Correct usage - side effects
students.forEach((student) {
  print('Welcome, $student!');     // Logging
  sendEmail(student);              // API call
  updateDatabase(student);         // Database update
});
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 9

(T/F) **forEach**: Returns `void`, used for side effects **map**: Returns `Iterable`, used for transformation

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 10

We can use forEach to collect data.

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 11

From this example, what is the mistake in using the map function?

```dart
// Wrong - returns Iterable, not List
var result = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);
print(result.runtimeType); // MappedListIterable<int, int>

// Correct - convert to List
var result = numbers.map((num) => num * 2).toList();
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 12

From this example, what is the mistake in using the map function?

```dart
// Wrong - awkward side effects
List<int> doubled = [];
numbers.forEach((num) => doubled.add(num * 2));

// Correct - use map
List<int> doubled = numbers.map((num) => num * 2).toList();
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 13

From this example, what is the mistake in using the map function?

```dart
// Wrong - waste of memory
students.map((student) => print(student));

// Correct - use forEach
students.forEach((student) => print(student));
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 14

We need a function that returns `true` if **at least one** item matches the condition. What should we use?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 14

We need a function that returns `true` if if **all** items match the condition. What should we use?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 15

How do take(), skip(), and takeWhile() functions work for partial collection processing?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 16

Use where, map, take and toList to filter out only the (1) long name, (2) upper case, (3) first two, and (4) list.

```dart
List<String> names = ['alice', 'bob', 'charlie', 'david', 'eve'];
// Complex chain: filter, transform, limit
List<String> result = names
  .??1((name) => name.length > 3)      // Filter long names
  .??2((name) => name.toUpperCase())     // Transform to uppercase
  .??3(2)                               // Take first 2
  .??4();                             // Convert to List
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 17

Write code that (1) selects even number (2) square them, (3) select larger than 10, and (4) convert them to a list.

```dart
// Numbers processing chain
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```
