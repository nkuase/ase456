What is a software testing technique where individual components or functions are tested in isolation?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 6.2

This is a list of the main benefits of unit tests, which is wrong.

- **Early Bug Detection**: Catch errors before they reach production
- **Code Quality**: Ensures functions work as expected
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as examples of how to use functions
- **Refactoring Safety**: Modify code with confidence
- **Design Improvement**: Writing tests forces better code design
- **Understanding Interactions among modules**: Writing interaction between modules.

**Answer:**

---

## Question 6.3

(T/F) To set up unit testing in a Dart project, we need to add a test dependency to pubspec.yaml.

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  test: ^1.24.0
```

**Answer:**

---

## Question 6.4

(T/F) To set up unit testing in a Dart project, we need to create a test directory structure:.

```txt
project/
  lib/
    calculator.dart
  test/
    calculator_test.dart
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 6.5

(T/F) To set up unit testing in a Dart project, we need to import the required packages in the test file.

```dart
import 'package:test/test.dart';
import '../lib/calculator.dart'; // Import code to test
```

## Question 6.6

How to run a Dart test?

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 6.7

```dart
void main() {
  ??1('description of what is being tested', () {
    // Arrange: Set up test data
    int a = 5;
    int b = 3;
    
    // Act: Execute the function being tested
    int result = add(a, b);
    
    // Assert: Verify the result
    ??2(result, ??3(8));
  });
}
```

This is the basic structure of a Dart test. Fill in ??#

## Question 6.11

When I need to check if the result is null, what is the keyword? Fill in ???

## Question 6.12

How do you organize tests using group(), setUp(), and tearDown()? Fill in ??#

```dart
void main() {
  ??1('Calculator Tests', () {
    Calculator? calculator;
    
    ??2(() {
      // Runs before each test in this group
      calculator = Calculator();
    });
    
    ??3(() {
      // Runs after each test (cleanup)
      calculator = null;
    });
    
    test('should add two numbers', () {
      expect(calculator!.add(2, 3), equals(5));
    });
```

**Answer:**

---

## Question 6.13

This is the test for exceptions and error conditions. Fill in ???

```dart
// Test that a function throws a specific exception
test('should throw ArgumentError for division by zero', () {
  Calculator calc = Calculator();
  expect(() => calc.divide(5, 0), throwsArgumentError);
});
test('should throw exception with correct message', () {
  Calculator calc = Calculator();
  expect(() => calc.divide(5, 0), 
    ??1(predicate((e) => e is ArgumentError && 
                     e.message == 'Cannot divide by zero')));
});
```

---

**Answer:**

---

This is a list of standard exception matchers. When nothing matches, what is the last one we use to catch any exception?

- `throwsArgumentError`
- `throwsFormatException`
- `throwsStateError`

## Question 6.14

There are four different categories of tests you should write. This is under normal conditions. What do we call it?

```dart
test('should add two positive numbers', () {
  expect(arith.add(2, 3), equals(5));
});
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 6.15

There are four different categories of tests you should write. These are the boundary conditions. What do we call it?

```dart
test('should handle zero values', () {
  expect(arith.add(0, 0), equals(0));
  expect(arith.multiply(5, 0), equals(0));
});

test('should handle negative numbers', () {
  expect(arith.add(-5, 3), equals(-2));
});
```

**Answer:**

---

## Question 6.16

There are four different categories of tests you should write. This is an invalid input condition. What do we call it?

```dart
test('should throw error for division by zero', () {
  expect(() => arith.divide(5, 0), throwsArgumentError);
});
```

---

**Answer:**

---

## Question 6.17

There are four different categories of tests you should write. This is a multiple operations condition. What do we call it?

```dart
test('should perform complex calculation', () {
  // (5 + 3) * 2 - 4 = 12
  int result = arith.subtract(arith.multiply(arith.add(5, 3), 2), 4);
  expect(result, equals(12));
});
```
